# Statistical Learning
This is a repository for basic machine learning codes.

I will be posting problems and codes for the course - **ECE1504 : Statistical Learning**, which is being conducted in Fall 2018 by Prof. Ashish Khisti at University of Toronto.
Codes will be posted once the submission deadlines are over to avoid plagiarism. 
I not only plan to post the solutions to the programming assignments but also the solutions of the non-programming assignments. 

Non-programming assignments are my own work. But the coding assignments are being worked out by my team of 2 people.
