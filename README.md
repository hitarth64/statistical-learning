# Statistical Learning
This is a repository for basic machine learning codes.

I will be posting problems and codes for the course - **ECE1504 : Statistical Learning**, which is being conducted in Fall 2018 by Prof. Ashish Khisti at University of Toronto.
Codes will be posted once the submission deadlines are over to avoid plagiarism. 

The coding assignments are being worked out by team of 2 people - myself and my friend.
